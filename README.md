# Problem-sets
 
This repository contains the problem sets of CS50P.

My goal is to all problem sets without using ChatGPT. Zero, nada. I will only use the course lectures, Python documentation and perhaps Google Search as information input.
I know ChatGPT can do all the code for me, however, my goal with this course is to *learn*.
